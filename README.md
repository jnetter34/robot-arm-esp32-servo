# 4DOF Robot Arm (ESP32 + MG996R)

This is a simple 4-degree-of-freedom robotic arm powered by four MG996R servos, controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. All parts were designed in Fusion 360 and 3D printed using PLA+ on a Neptune 3 Pro. This project is part of my personal portfolio as a MechE student at Purdue University :).

## Features
- 4 MG996R servo motors for arm articulation
- ESP32 microcontroller for control logic
- Powered via external 5V DC power supply
- Manual joystick control via ESP-NOW (in progress)
- Printed using PLA+ on Neptune 3 Pro

## Hardware List
- 1 × ESP32 Dev Module
- 4 × MG996R servo motors
- 1 × 5V 6A DC power supply
- 1 × PCA9685 servo driver (optional for smoother control)
- Jumper wires, breadboard or perfboard
- Custom 3D printed arm 

## Software Tools
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
- Fusion 360 for CAD modeling
- GitHub for version control
